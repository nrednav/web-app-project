# Web App Dev Project

For this project, I had to develop a web application for a topic of my choice, using the Ruby on Rails framework.

I chose to model a restaurants website that included basic support for the ordering of food online.

The base idea was to have a restaurant that serves three asian cuisines: 
> Chinese, Japanese & Korean

## General Overview

> 2. Contact:

> 3. Register:

> 4. Login:

> 5. Cuisine selection:

> 6. Example course content (Beverages):

> 7. Order summary

> 8. View previous orders:

## Testing the application

To test this web application you would need to have Ruby and the Rails gem installed.

Navigate into the root directory of this project and run the following command: `rails s`.

To view the website you must then visit: `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser of your choice.
