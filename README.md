# Web App Dev Project

For this project, I had the freedom of choosing a topic of my choice for which I chose to model a restaurants website that included basic support for the ordering of food online.

My approach to this was to create a restaurant that served 3 asian cuisines: Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

## Testing the application

To test this web application you would need to have Ruby and the Rails gem installed.

Navigate into the root directory of this project and run the following command: `rails s`.

To view the website you must then visit: `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser of your choice.
